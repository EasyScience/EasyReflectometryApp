Context 
-------

The EasyReflectometry application and Python library should have a consistant naming structure, such that it is clear to all users what is being installed and how they can access different functionality once installed. 
It should be possible for the Python library to be installed without the installing the application and all of the names should be distinct. 
In this ADR, we outline this naming conventions.

Decision
--------

We will break this outline up into the Python library and the application. 

EasyReflectometryLib
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from the lowest level, the Python library. 
The Python library project will be :mod:`EasyReflectometryLib` and therefore to install from PyPI will require the following command. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install EasyReflectometryLib

However, once installed, it should be possible to access the Python library within a Python script as :mod:`EasyReflectometry`.
Therefore, the following Python commands will return the Python library version number (which may not be the same as the application version number). 

.. code-block:: python 

    >>> import EasyReflectometry
    >>> print(EasyReflectometry.__version__)
    '0.0.2' # This is the version number at time of writing

EasyReflectometryApp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application will commonly be referred to by users are EasyReflectometry, and indeed it should be usable without the understanding that there is a Python library foundation. 
This said, the application project will be :mod:`EasyReflectometryApp` and should the application be installable via PyPI, the following command would be necessary. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install EasyReflectometryApp

If then run from the command line, the application can be launched with the following. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ EasyReflectometry

N.B. this is achieved by having the :code:`project.scripts` defined in the :code:`pyproject.toml`, `see here`_. 

The local installer that is built by the continuous integration should not refer to :mod:`EasyReflectometryApp`, rather the name of the installer and also the application therein should be :code:`EasyReflectometry`. 
We achieve this with the separate definition of a :code:`name` and an :code:`app_name` in the :code:`pyproject.toml`, `as shown here`_.

Consequences
------------

The primary consequence of this decision is that there is clarity in the naming structure of the EasyReflectometry application and Python library.
This convention should be followed in future development and care taken not to deviate.
