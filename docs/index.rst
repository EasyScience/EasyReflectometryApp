Developer Documentation
=======================

This is the home of the EasyReflectometry developer documentation, covering both the `application`_ and the `Python library`_ that it is built on. 
This is distinct from the `Python library documentation`_, which covers how to use the Python library and details the API. 
This developer documentation is aimed at those interested in contributing to the EasyReflectometry project as a whole. 
Therefore, this will be where information for developers will be found, such as how to build a suitable development environment, Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and information on how the continuous integration works.
