# EasyReflectometry

This is the home of the EasyReflectometry developer documentation, covering both the [application](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyReflectometryApp) and the [Python library](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyReflectometryLib) that it is built on. 
This is distinct from the [Python library documentation](https://docs.easyreflectometry.org), which covers how to use the Python library and details the API. 
This developer documentation is aimed at those interested in contributing to the EasyReflectometry project as a whole. 
Therefore, this will be where information for developers will be found, such as how to build a suitable development environment, Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and information on how the continuous integration works.
